# Covid-Management app(Capstone project)
Android application (Covid Management Assistant) which helps to manage the problems created by the global pandemic Covid-19 within a small business where employees’ size is approximately 10-100. 
This application is focused on small businesses as the structure of this application only supports small business and is not as effective if large number of employees are present.
This application plays two main roles in helping an organization for fighting with Covid-19. Firstly, it helps to track and understand the transmission of covid by tracking user 
location, asking for employee’s input and alerting employees based on the calculation. Secondly it helps for better management by providing important resources like 
self-assessment features, helpful resources link, and portal to share covid-results or insurance information.
